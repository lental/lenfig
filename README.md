# Lenfig

This is a repository of configuration files used for my \*nix computers.

# Files that should be aliased

If you check out the repo, you would probably want to symlink the following files to your home directory:

1. .vimrc
1. .vim (a folder)
1. .slate
1. .gitignore\_global


# Files that should be sourced in your .bash_profile

Instead of symlinking the following files, it could be easier to just add a source line to your .bash_profile

1. .bashrc
1. .bash_aliases
